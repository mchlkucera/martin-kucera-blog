### Audio Regeneration (After ElevenLabs Quota Reset)

**Priority:** High
**When:** After next ElevenLabs billing cycle (quota resets monthly)

The blog's audio files need to be regenerated after migrating storage from Vercel Blob to Cloudflare R2. The original audio files could not be migrated because Vercel Blob was blocked.

See: [docs/audio-regeneration.md](docs/audio-regeneration.md)
